title: "Raisons D'etre"

In my view, the world is an intricate tapestry, and our actions are threads that can either strengthen or fray it. I believe in looking at the big picture - how our choices ripple through time and space, impacting not just us, but future generations and the planet itself. It's about considering the whole chessboard, not just the next move.

For me, what counts isn't the applause or the accolades, but the mark we leave on this complex system. It's about adding to our collective understanding, our shared wisdom. I approach doing good with a scientist's eye - practical, questioning, seeking evidence for what truly works. And like a scientist, I recognize that we're just a small part of a vast universe, yet we have a role in maintaining its balance. This philosophy, like a fundamental law of physics, guides me to prioritize the long-term health of our world and its inhabitants over the fleeting spotlight of personal glory.
