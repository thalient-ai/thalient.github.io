Thalient Cybernetics is built on the concepts of [Thalience](https://www.kschroeder.com/my-books/ventus/thalience) and [Cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics:_Or_Control_and_Communication_in_the_Animal_and_the_Machine). In traditional cybernetics, systems are designed to respond and adapt based on human-defined parameters and models. My goal is to take this further by enabling systems to autonomously develop their own models of the world such that they can independently interpret, understand, and interact with their surroundings. 

I believe that the future of technology lies in its ability to align with and enrich the human experience. My objective is to foster the development of technology where human values and technological innovation go hand in hand. And, to use transformative approaches to how we interact with, understand, and utilize technology to comprehend and relate to the world around us. Simply put, I want to harmonize the advancement of cybernetics with the enrichment of human life.
