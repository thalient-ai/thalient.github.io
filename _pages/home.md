At Thalient, we believe that the future of technology lies in its ability to align with and enrich the human experience. We foster the development of technology where human values and technological innovation go hand in hand. And, we use transformative approaches to how we interact with, understand, and utilize technology in our quest to comprehend and relate to the world around us. No matter the application, our goal remains the same: to harmonize the advancement of cybernetics with the enrichment of human life.

Our foundation is built on the concepts of [Thalience](https://www.kschroeder.com/my-books/ventus/thalience) and [Cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics:_Or_Control_and_Communication_in_the_Animal_and_the_Machine). In traditional cybernetics, systems are designed to respond and adapt based on human-defined parameters and models. Our goal is to take this further by enabling systems to autonomously develop their own models of the world such that they can independtly interpret, understand, and interact with their surroundings, potentially leading to novel insights and approaches.

At its core, Thalience represents the evolution of scientific inquiry into a realm where science and subjective human experience intersect. It suggests a future where automated, non-human intelligences conduct scientific research, potentially developing models of the universe that, while objectively accurate, may differ from human understanding.
