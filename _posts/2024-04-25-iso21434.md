ISO 21434 (fully known as ISO/SAE 21434:2021 (E)) is an international standard that addresses cybersecurity for road vehicles. Established to ensure the safety, integrity, and confidentiality of automotive systems, this standard provides a framework for managing cybersecurity risks throughout the lifecycle of a vehicle. It covers areas such as risk assessment, incident response, and continuous improvement, providing automotive manufacturers and suppliers with clear guidelines on how to incorporate cybersecurity practices into the design, development, production, operation, maintenance, and decommissioning of vehicle-related components and systems. ISO 21434 aims to mitigate potential cybersecurity threats in an increasingly connected automotive environment.

The standard is complex and not user-friendly due to its lack of a clear table listing all requirements, recommendations, permissions, and work products. The main content, including important requirements, is often interspersed with notes and examples, which can make understanding the core requirements challenging. Additionally, the standard frequently references other sections and requirements within itself, creating a convoluted reading experience that requires constant cross-referencing. This format can be confusing and makes it difficult to quickly comprehend and apply the guidelines effectively.

To address these challenges, I have created an Airtable embedded below that lists the content of ISO 21434 in a table format. The table includes figure and tables where appropriate as well as interactive mappings between the Work Products and Requirements.
