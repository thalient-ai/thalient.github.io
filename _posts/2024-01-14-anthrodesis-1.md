I'm writing this post because, in my experience, there is not a lot of information or judgement-free support for those who are given an option of either surgical fusion or elective amputation.

In August of 2023, I had a freak accident that resulted in (as every doctor put it - some with empathy and others witout) a life-changing injury. My left ankle was destroyed, I had open tibia pilon and fibula fractures.

My first surgery was triage and the installation of an external fixator. A month later, I had surgery to fuse what remained of my ankle. I was bedbound for months which comes with its own challenges like muscle loss and pain.

Due to the severity of my injury, ankle replacement was not an option - or rather one with immediate arthritis and constant pain. Instead, I chose to fuse the ankle which itself was risky again due the severity of the fracture. While the term "fracture" evokes a mental image of a break, my injury (i.e., pilon) is more like a smash and grind.

At this point in my recovery, if I was given the choice I would choose amputation. I will likely get elective amputation in the coming years after giving fusion "it's best shot".

What I want to discuss is judgement and loss. 

Those who are healthy in their mobility, in my opinion, tend not to understand the perspective of the injured. To me, my loss has already hapoened - there is no full recovery. I will never run, I will never jump but I can limp along with a stump of a leg. Giving it up, I feel would improve my quality of life, I feel it would enable me to do those active things again. I don't fear the amputation, I don't fear the phantom pain, I don't fear the prosthetics. What I fear is not being able to live life to the fullest.

Maybe my opinion will change with time. Maybe I am wrong, but with the options laid in front of me I would choose amputation simply because it provides more utility.

When I've brought up these thoughts with medical practitioners, it was met with concern, disgust, hesistancy, and bewilderment but never with openness and real dialogue.

For those in a similar situation, you can reach out to me and I will listen.
